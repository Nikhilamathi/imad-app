                <p> People milling around I  do not notice them, 
                    my face is turned to hide my loneliness,
                    Am walking in my own despair
                    No one else intrudes on my thoughts of 
                    "How they were"
                </p>
                <p> My heart is broken Feelings are numb
                    Trying to be the person I once was
                    People see my dimpled smile
                    Cannot see the ripped up emotions
                    Of reality.
